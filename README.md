# Hip Muscle Moment Arm Inversion Visual

Visualizes hip muscle action changes with progressive hip flexion (generates a .gif).
Originally created with the intention to use during thesis defense but ended up removing it last minute.

This project pulls muscle origin/insertion points and local boney landmarks (Horsman et al. 2007) to reconstruct the hip region in 3D.
Muscle line of actions are treated as **straight lines** and does not account of muscle wrapping.
The goal of this project was to visualize the inversion of actions the deep gluteal muscles undergo with
progressive hip flexion.

Data is pulled from: *Horsman, K, Koopman HFJM, et al. (2007). Morphological muscle and joint parameters for
musculoskeletal modelling of the lower extremity. Clinical Biomechanics, 22: 239-247.*  Currently only the gluteal
muscles are visualized, but can easily be modified to include all muscles reprorted by Horsman et al (2007).
